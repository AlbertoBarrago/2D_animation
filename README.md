# Canvas 2D Math Animations

A collection of mathematical animations rendered using pure Canvas 2D API, inspired by Tsoding's philosophy of creating beautiful animations without WebGL or external libraries.

## About

This project demonstrates various mathematical concepts through interactive animations, all implemented using vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas 2D rendering context. No frameworks, no libraries, no WebGL - just pure math and code.

## Features

- **Orbit**: Simple circular motion demonstrating basic trigonometry
- **Lissajous**: Beautiful Lissajous curves with trailing effect
- **Spiral**: Expanding spiral pattern
- **Wave**: Multiple sine waves with different frequencies
- **Particles**: Colorful particles moving in circular formation
- **Breathing Circle**: Rotating and scaling geometric pattern
- **Mandala**: Multi-layered rotating mandala pattern
- **Tunnel**: Hypnotic tunnel effect with expanding rings

## Controls

- Click any animation button to switch between different animations
- Use the speed slider to control animation speed

## Running Locally

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No build process, no dependencies, no installation required.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd animation

# Open in your browser (macOS example)
open index.html
```
